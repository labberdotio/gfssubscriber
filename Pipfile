# 
# I am on a roll testing the API on many different platforms, including
#
# - MacOS 11.6, python 3.6 (3.6.12)
# - Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS, python 3.6 (3.6.9)
# - Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, python 3.8 (3.8.10)
# - CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core), python 3.6 (3.6.8)
# - Rocky Linux 8.4, python 3.6 (3.6.8)
# - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4, python 3.6 (3.6.8)
#
# I found that on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4, when installing and testing with python 3.9, 
# the pip requirements fail to install properly and the test suite fails to run. I think I 
# will have explicitly specify python 3.6 here and make sure it is available on all test 
# platforms. 
# 
# Now that python 3.6 is EOL I am upgrading the version of python to version 3.8.
# 
# Here are the various versions of python the API has been tested with
# - python 2.7, original version API was developed with on MacOS
# - python 3.4, early python3 version on MacOS, and CentOS 7 version
# - python 3.6, python3 version on MacOS, Ubuntu 18.04, and Alpine 3.9
# - python 3.8, python3 version on MacOS, Ubuntu 20.04, and Alpine 3.12
# 
# python_version = "3"
# python_version = "3.6"
python_version = "3.8"
